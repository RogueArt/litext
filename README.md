# Litext

Litext is a full stack application written in NodeJS, Express, MongoDB that lets you add authors and books to an online database.
The application is work-in-progress but you can try the demo [here](https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps/litext/deploy/heroku-git).

Note: It will say that there has been an error creating your book, but it does actually get saved. No way to retrieve it yet though!
